Hey, I am Yingjing Huang (黄颖菁). 👋

I am a Ph.D. candidate in geographic information science at Peking University, China, under the joint supervision of Prof. Lun Wu (邬伦), Prof. Yu Liu (刘瑜), and Prof. Fan Zhang (张帆). Previously, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at the MIT Senseable City Lab for one year. I hold a bachelor’s and master’s degree from Wuhan University, China.

My research intersects GIScience, Geospatial Data Science, and Computer Vision, with a focus on urban visual AI and its implications for guiding urban planning.

Currently, I am working on my doctoral thesis, which focuses on using GeoAI to represent the urban visual environment based on city imagery, primarily involving remote sensing imagery and street-level imagery. We want to understand how humans transform urban physical spaces and how these spaces, in turn, reflect human daily life.

I am actively seeking Postdoc positions at the moment.
