Hey, I am Yingjing Huang (黄颖菁). 👋

I hold a Ph.D. in Cartograpghy and Geographic Information Science from Peking University, China. During my doctoral studies, I was jointly supervised by Prof. Lun Wu (邬伦), [Prof. Yu Liu (刘瑜)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Xh_lRY4AAAAJ&hl=en), and [Prof. Fan Zhang (张帆)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dc1TzLoAAAAJ&hl=en). I spent one year as a visiting Ph.D. student at the [MIT Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/) for one year, jointly supervised by [Prof. Carlo Ratti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UF2gBtMAAAAJ), [Dr. Fábio Duarte](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oI9m0yYAAAAJ), and [Dr. Simone Mora](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FcRSf0IAAAAJ). I hold a bachelor's and master’s degree from Wuhan University, China, where I was advised by [Prof. Teng Fei (费腾)](https://only4john.github.io/).

My research lies at the intersection of GIScience and computer vision, focusing on urban visual AI and its applications in urban planning.

**I am currently seeking new opportunities as a faculty member or postdoctoral researcher.**
