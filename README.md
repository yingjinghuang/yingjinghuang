Hi, I am Yingjing Huang (黄颖菁). 👋

I am an incoming University Assistant Postdoc at the University of Vienna. I hold a Ph.D. in Geographic Information Science from Peking University, China, where I was advised by Prof. Lun Wu (邬伦), Prof. Yu Liu (刘瑜), and Prof. Fan Zhang (张帆). During my doctoral studies, I also spent one year as a visiting researcher at the MIT Senseable City Lab, working with Prof. Carlo Ratti, Dr. Fábio Duarte, and Dr. Simone Mora. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Wuhan University under the supervision of Prof. Teng Fei (费腾).

My research stands at the intersection of GIScience and Computer Vision. I focus on Urban Visual Intelligence, developing deep learning methods to analyze urban physical environments and their interactions with human activities.
